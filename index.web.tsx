/**
 * THE BROWSER ENTRY POINT.
 *
 * Uses AppRegistry rather than react-dom's createRoot directly. That is
 * not ceremony: react-native-web's AppRegistry.runApplication() is what
 * installs the style sheet its StyleSheet API compiles into, sets up the
 * root container's own layout defaults, and mounts under the same
 * AppContainer the rest of the library expects. Mounting <App/> with
 * ReactDOM alone renders unstyled boxes.
 *
 * The `App` specifier below resolves to App.web.tsx - vite.config.ts puts
 * `.web.tsx` ahead of `.tsx` in resolve.extensions, the same precedence
 * Metro applies in reverse for the Android build. Neither entry imports
 * the other.
