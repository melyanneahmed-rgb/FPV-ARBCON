/**
 * Phase 2H - the real Arabic motor-test screen.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS. A presentation and gesture layer over the accepted
 * controller, reached through the ONE official binding. It renders state
 * and forwards intent. It is not, and must never become, a safety
 * authority.
 *
 * WHAT IT STRUCTURALLY CANNOT DO - by construction, not by convention:
 *   - It never imports or calls `writeBytes`, a transport, an `MspClient`,
 *     a lease, an encoder or a motor vector.
 *   - It never names command 214, 1050 or 1000, and never builds a
 *     payload. The only motor-shaped value it handles is an output slot
 *     number, 1..4, which it hands to the controller unchanged.
 *   - It never creates a second session, authority, controller or queue.
 *     Its timers belong only to the owned gesture: on web one qualifies
 *     the documented 800 ms continuous hold, and the other renews the
 *     controller's short fail-safe while the same Pressable still owns
 *     that gesture. Neither timer can bypass pulseMotor()'s call-time gate.
 *   - It re-derives NO safety condition. Armed state, lease, authority,
 *     scope and capability are evaluated once, in the controller, and read
 *     here as `snapshot.activation` - the SAME evaluation `pulseMotor()`
 *     itself performs. Battery suitability is an explicit bench warning and
 *     is never presented as an automatic controller fact.
 *
 * WHY `Ready` IS NOT THE GATE. Phase 2G established that a locking safety
 * event arriving while idle leaves the accepted reducer in `Ready` - it
 * correctly refuses to manufacture stop traffic for an activation that
 * never began - while activation must nonetheless be barred. So this
 * screen gates on `activation.allowed`, never on the reducer state alone.
 *
 * WHAT AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT MEANS HERE. An MSP ACK proves the flight
 * controller received and processed a command. It never proves a motor
 * turned, at what speed, in which direction, or that any motor stopped.
 * No string in this file claims otherwise, and a test asserts it.
 *
 * Bench warnings are always visible, but there is no checkbox ritual.
 * Session preparation is an explicit action, separate from the motor hold:
 * an asynchronous MSP bring-up must never consume the gesture that the
 * operator reasonably expects to move one motor.

   * Navigation to the post-connection route happens earlier, when ownership
   * goes ACTIVE, so this panel can mount while no capability exists yet.
   *
   * This used to be a `useMemo` keyed on `sessionKey.sessionId` - a value
   * that never changes for the life of the mounted panel. Under stack
   * navigation the screen remounted per navigation, so a read that came
   * back `undefined` could not persist. Under the tab shell the panel
   * mounts once and is kept alive with `display: 'none'`, so `undefined`
   * became PERMANENT: blocked presentation forever, hold control `disabled`
   * forever, pressing it doing nothing at all.
   *
   * State plus a store subscription rather than a memo with an epoch
   * dependency: `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` correctly rejects that epoch
   * as unnecessary, and a dependency the linter wants removed is a fix that
   * silently un-fixes itself the first time someone tidies the warning.

     *
     * Both halves of that sentence were measured, not reasoned about, and
     * each replaced a wrong earlier version of this function.
     *
     * (1) NOT GUARDED ON `machine`. The first attempt returned early when
     *     `machine === undefined`. But `initializeSession()` takes the
     *     exclusive lease and the telemetry pause DURING setup, before the
     *     machine exists, so that guard leaked the likeliest operator
     *     window - the second between pressing begin and reaching Ready.
     *
     * (2) NOT AN IMMEDIATE, UNCONDITIONAL `endSession()` either. That
     *     version fixed the two settled cases and broke the unsettled one.
     *     Tearing down while a lease-guarded setup request is still in
     *     flight cannot work: `MspClient.releaseMotorTestLease` refuses
     *     while `active`/`queue` is non-empty and answers
     *     LEASE_WORK_UNSETTLED (mspClient.ts:1292), the controller
     *     correctly treats unresolved ownership as a reason to KEEP
     *     telemetry paused (motorTestController.ts:3219), and nothing ever
     *     retries. The measured result was a session wedged for good:
     *     phase CLOSED, machine Fault, lease held, telemetry paused
     *     forever. Left to itself the same departure ended
     *     CLOSED/Locked with leaseRelease RELEASED, because the bridge's
     *     `requestStop` drives the controller's OWN teardown, which
     *     releases at a point where its own in-flight work has settled.
     *
     * KNOWN GAP, recorded in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md ("Known gaps - future
     * hardening") rather than fixed here: the missing piece is a
     * retry-on-settle inside `MspClient` itself, which would hold for every
     * future caller instead of only for the one that remembered to wait.
     * That file is frozen for this work and changing it needs its own
     * approval, so this screen waits instead.
     *
     * So the rule is: the controller's own stop path knows when releasing
     * is possible and an outside caller does not. Defer to it whenever it
     * is acting, and only step in for the states it leaves alone - a
     * session sitting at Ready, or one still setting up that will reach
     * Ready after the operator has already gone.
     *
     * This delays no stop and weakens no gate. A pulse in flight is the
     * bridge's business and is unaffected: `requestStop` still fires
     * synchronously on blur, exactly as before. All this decides is who
     * hands back the lease afterwards, and when.
